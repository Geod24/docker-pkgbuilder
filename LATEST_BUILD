# This file is here to keep track of the last build date
# when no change is to be made to the Dockerfile.
# A rebuild could also be triggered from Dockercloud hub,
# but it wouldn't leave a trace and might make tracing
# issues harder.
#
# Used `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` (--iso-8601 doesn't work on Mac).
